        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>At Your Task Hub, I believe that everyone can benefit from having a simple and effective tool to manage their daily tasks. <br/>
        I was inspired to create this project based on my own struggles with staying organized and on top of my task lists. <br/></p>

        <p> As a Portfolio Project for Holberton School, I decided to create a task list as a way to showcase my skills <br/>
        and to help others overcome the challenges of task management. <br/>
        I hope that this project will make a positive impact in people's lives and help them achieve their goals.</p>
